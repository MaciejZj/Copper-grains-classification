# Copper-grains-classification

My bachelor's degree project covering the topic of copper ore grains
classification based on thermal images.
The project includes data analysis and feature extraction from footage acquired
using active thermography approach.
The copper grains are characterised by tracking the number of spots with lower
thermal emissivity.
Classification algorithm utilizes a neural network developed with Keras
interface.

The neural network is a proof of concept construct, to provide
practical rationale for presented method of classifying grains.

Feel free to check out my [thesis](https://github.com/MaciejZj/Bachelors-thesis)
(written in Polish), which offers in-depth insight into the project and research.
