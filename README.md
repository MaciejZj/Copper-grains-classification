# Copper-grains-classification

My bachelor's degree project covering the topic of copper ore grains
classification based on thermal images.
The project includes data analysis and feature extraction from footage acquired
using active thermography approach.
The copper grains are characterised by tracking the number of spots with lower
thermal emissivity.
Classification algorithm utilizes a neural network developed with Keras
interface.

Feel free to check out my [thesis](https://github.com/MaciejZj/Bachelor-thesis),
which offers in-depth insight into the project and research.
